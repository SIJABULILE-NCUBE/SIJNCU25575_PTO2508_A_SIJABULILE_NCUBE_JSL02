                  Task Input and Status Validation System 

This project is a basic Kanban-style task board.

It was built using:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

The layout includes a sidebar and three task columns:
TODO, DOING and DONE.

## Project Overview

The page displays a task board design and runs a JavaScript file when it loads.

The script:
- Prompts the user to enter two tasks
- Requests a title and description for each task
- Asks for the task status (todo, doing, or done)
- Validates the status input
- Logs completed tasks in the browser console

If no tasks are marked as done, a message is displayed in the console.
